# 🛍️ Attacus & Psyche Website (a bespoke event management platform for night walks)

This is a minimal full-stack event platform built over a previous project (product page). It allows users to view events, add them to a cart, and make payments securely through Razorpay. The backend handles authentication, protected routes, and payment processing — all designed with simplicity, performance, and a hint of nocturnal elegance.
